TODO:

. experiment with team-specific model weights
	- when shuffling games, during training, the average loss is sort of in ballpark, but at test time, the average loss still ranges quite a bit.
	- when not shuffling games, the average loss decreases from it 0 to 1 when only using average past passing network, but then stabilizes. When adding in other features, the average loss changes.

	On 5 iterations
	- Average past passing network on r-16: 17.538955
	- + isSamePos: 17.425177
	- + isSamePos + isDiffPos: 15.860132
	- + isSamePos + isDiffPos + isHigherRank: 16.038312
	- + isSamePos + isDiffPos + wonAgainstSimilarTeam: 15.754991
	- + isSamePos + isDiffPos + wonAgainstSimilarTeam + avgPassVol: 15.701996
	- + isSamePos + isDiffPos + wonAgainstSimilarTeam + avgPassVol + avgPassPerc: 15.809034

	Good: Improves when adding features
	Bad: Worse than baseline

. experiment with MORE iterations (like 10-20?)
. see why the weights stabilize so quickly when using one set of weights??

. see if above improves with iterations
	- able to see decrease or at least a change in average loss (though it sometimes rises a little bit in between iterations...like by 0.03) when shuffling or not shuffling
	
. add intro to writeup
