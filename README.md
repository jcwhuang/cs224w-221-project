# A network-assisted approach to predicting passing distributions #
## Final project for CS224W at Stanford University ##
###Autumn 2015###

**Data:** UEFA Champions League 2014-15

Type of data: Relevant directory
* passing distributions: passing_distributions/
* rankings: rankings/
* squad lists: squads/
* scores: scores/
* tactical lineups: lineup/
* individual player statistics: player_statistics/

**Goal:** Based on games from the group stage, predict passing distributions
for games in the round of 16 stage

**Results:** Our linear regression model exceeded our baseline (average past
passing network) by 25.27%
